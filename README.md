# Text-Analysis
This is a Gender Text Analysis project which focuses on predicting the gender of an author based on their written stories, leveraging the principles of natural language processing and machine learning.


# NOTE:
 Please note that the GridSearch diagram in this code cell
 may not be displayed correctly on GitHub, because of that I added visually representation of the results(Screenshots).
 Alternatively, you can check the file: "Assignment5-text-analysis - Jupyter Notebook.pdf" or download the
 notebook and open it locally using Google Colab.
